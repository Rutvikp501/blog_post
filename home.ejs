        <h1>Project Description: Blogging Platform</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our Blogging Platform! This platform allows users to create, manage, and share their blog posts effortlessly. Below are the steps to get started:</p>
        
        <h2>User Management:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Create User: Begin by creating a user account. Provide necessary details like name, email, and password. Upon successful creation, you will receive a unique user ID.</li>
            <li>Login: Once you've created your user account, you can log in using your email and password.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Blog Post Management:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Get All Posts: Use the provided URL to fetch all the existing posts from all users. This gives you an overview of the content available on the platform.</li>
            <li>Create Post: To share your thoughts or content, create a new blog post. You'll need to provide a title, content, and the author's Email (which you have used while creating user). All fields are mandatory.(Just to keep track in case we need author based posts)</li>
            <li>View Post: After creating a post, you can view it by accessing its unique post ID, which you can obtain from the list of all posts.</li>
            <li >Get Single Post: Retrieve a single post by providing either the user/author's ID or the post's ID. This allows you to access specific content quickly.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Post Update and Deletion:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li >Update Post: If you need to make changes to a post, use the provided URL with the post's ID in the parameters. You can update the post's content or title as needed.</li>
            <li>Delete Post: In case you want to remove a post, simply provide the post's ID in the URL parameters. This action deletes the specified post permanently.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <a href="http://localhost:5111/sgr"><h2>Swagger Documentation:</h2></a>
        <p>The entire API is documented using Swagger, providing clear endpoints and instructions on how to interact with each functionality.</p>
